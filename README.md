## Environment Setup

If you want to contribute to system development, clone the project to any folder to begin setting up your environment

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```
### 2. Configure your Foundry Data Path

Copy and rename `example.foundryconfig.json` to `foundryconfig.json` and change the `path` property to your Foundry's Data location

### 3. Build the project

```
npm run build
```
This will build the project into the location specified by the path property in step 2, which provides a working system that Foundry can use.
